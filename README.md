# Terraform
Have you ever wondered why your colonists can't just dig up some soil and bring it back to your mountain base? Have you ever wanted to make an artificial desert, a marsh moat or just add come lichen-covered dirt for aesthetics?

Well fear not, for I bring you Terraform!

Now, before we start. I know there are other mods that more or less do the same thing and most of them are probably more balanced than this one. On the other hand, since most of my mods were originally made just for my own personal use (just like this one), I might as well publish this one too.

Now, let's get started. First of all, the terrain tiles you'll be able to build don't cost anything except time. Lots of time. No, seriously. It will take a lengthy time for your colonists to convert the terrain. That's the catch, it's more like an opportunity cost; you could be doing other stuff but you decided to do this instead.

Obviously it wouldn't be even near balanced if you could just build fertile soil everywhere. I tried to make it somewhat tiered; you convert infertile diggable terrain into gravel, then you can convert gravel into any other fertile terrain type. You can also build gravel on smooth stone. However, you can't just start converting gravel into fertile soil right away. Terrain types are locked behind research so you'll gradually unlock stuff as you progress.

# Balance
I should probably increase the work to build the terrains. Probably.
